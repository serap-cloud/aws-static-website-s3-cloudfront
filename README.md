# AWS Static Website Deployment (S3 + CloudFront)

This project deploys a fully serverless and globally available static website using:

- Amazon S3 (static site hosting)
- CloudFront (CDN distribution)
- IAM (secure access policies)
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

## Architecture
User -> CloudFront -> S3 Bucket

## What I Learned
- Creating an S3 static hosting bucket
- Writing Terraform IaC modules
- Managing IAM roles & policies
- Building reproducible AWS infrastructure
